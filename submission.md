### Module 6: Visualization & Reporting
**Owner:** Ethan Seba

- Implemented `show_status()` for formatted terminal output using colorama.
- Built `show_gui()` using Tkinter to visually display job queue in a table.
- Used test data for demonstration; functions can be called after any major queue event.
- GUI meets the optional extra credit requirement in the project brief.
